This dictionary contains the source code to calculate the Liutex.
The source code from http://www.jhydrodynamics.com/en/download-of-liutex-code is too slow.
I added the calculating expressions of P, Q, R, and delta with the field manipulating tools in OpenFOAM, which **enhances the implementing speed dramatically**.
For my case with 2 million cells, the serial implementation is done within 6 seconds.
Feel free to download and use it.
