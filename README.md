This zip file contains the source code to calculate the Liutex.
The source code from http://www.jhydrodynamics.com/en/download-of-liutex-code contains is too slow.
I add the calculating expressions with the field manipulating tools in OpenFOAM, which enhance the implementing speed.
For my case with 2 million cells, the serial implementation is done within 6 second.
Feel free to download and use it.
